In most of the  college campus, students often face challenges/difficulty in finding the right people to help them with academic subjects, projects, or creative collaborations and other group works.

This lead to missed of learning opportunities, uncompleted projects, and under utilized student potentials. The pressure of keeping up alone can also affect mental well-being and confidence of students .
